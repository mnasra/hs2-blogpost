# "Has HS2 affected the Birmingham property market?" Blogpost code
This code was used to do the analysis containted in [this blogpost](https://medium.com/@michaelnasra/has-hs2-affected-the-birmingham-property-market-229224f41599). This project was done as part of my Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.
##### Software used
Python 3.8.1

##### Libraries used 
pandas
numpy
seaborn
datetime
geopy
matplotlib

##### Summary of results
- Property sales numbers rose after the HS2 announcement before falling in 2019, perhaps due to the Brexit referendum result
- Property prices rose year on year in similar amounts to the UK average. A key point to note is the percentage increase in property prices in the last 2 years for properties within 1km of the new HS2 station were very high.
- The number of properties built in the last decade is similar to that of recent times. This may be due to a large number of properties in development that are not included in these values

##### Files included in repository
- HS2 Analysis.ipynb - Notebook containing the code written for the analysis
- data/Land Registry Price Paid Data.csv - File containing details of each property sale in the Birmingham area between 2009 and 2019
- data/VOA Property Age Data.csv - File containing number of properties built in each time period in the Birmingham area.
